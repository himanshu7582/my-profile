	<p>From sports to studies  i was  an average boy . Till my VIII class i crammed all subjects even maths also  without understanding .But from IX class i started understanding concepts and found that cramming is more difficult as compared to understanding .subject i hate most was social studies ,many time i try to found interset in social studies but always fails(not in exam) .In tenth class i got 7.6 cgpa which is not good for getting science stream in my school. But after my request and  school needs of getting more students i got non-medical in XI class. In XII class i got 70.8% .both X and XII percentages have some common relationship with my friend  percentages(9.6 cgpa and 90.8%).And the relationship is exact 20% difference.  Till my XII class i have fear of computer science , thats why? I choose physical education as my fifth subject not the c++. I was not interested in computers and i use them only for  gaming , music and other time pass purposes . i was the biggest cricket fan but  as the time passes out my intersets also changes .

		In past i have no relation  with computer science .I am totally dependent on destiny and by destiny i got admission in B.Tech(IT) .Initially i am  scared and found all these programming languages and computer science subjects  difficult. Actually these are difficult but not as we think.slowly slowly i entered in field of computer science and started learning programming languages  like c,c++ in my college .In fourth semester i started learning HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT (beginner level).After fourth semester i started BOOTSTRAP which is JS and CSS Framework used for making responsive websites . After learning all these things i made my own website .Website designing is really very interesting subjects .
